# NitGen Discord Bot

![NitGen Logo](nitgen-logo.png)

NitGen is a powerful Discord bot designed to generate Nitro codes. Discord Nitro offers premium perks and features on the platform, including access to exclusive content, animated emojis, and boosted servers. However, it's essential to note that generating a working Nitro code is an exceedingly rare occurrence. To ensure the security of the bot and verify requests, a token-based authentication system is implemented.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è

‚ö°Ô∏è Generating a working Nitro code is an extremely rare event and cannot be guaranteed. Please be aware of this fact when using NitGen. The bot provides a code generation service, but the probability of obtaining a valid Nitro code is very low. Use this service responsibly and do not abuse it.

üîí Token Authentication: To safeguard the integrity of NitGen and prevent misuse, an authentication token is required for request verification. Please keep your token secure and avoid sharing it with others.

## How to Use NitGen

To use NitGen, you need to obtain an authentication token for verification purposes. Once you have the token, you can make a request to the NitGen API to generate a Nitro code. Please note that you should handle the token securely and not share it with anyone.
